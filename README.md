# Welcome to Bamazon! 

I've created an Amazon-like storefront utilizing MySQL and Node.js run from the command line. 

### Customer Portal
Visit the store as a **customer** with command: *node bamazonCustomer.js*, and you'll see prompts such as this:

Choose your destiny. Should you choose door #1, you'll see the current inventory:

Choose to make a purchase:

Choose to view last chance, low inventory items, and you'll see just that:

### Manager Portal
Visiting the store as a **manager** grants you additional control. Along with basic access to viewing inventory and low inventory items, the manager has the ability to add to inventory. Access the manager portal with command: *node bamazonManager.js*:
